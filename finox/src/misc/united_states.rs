The CFTC Swaps Report is released at 3:30 p.m.
Eastern time on Wednesday of each week unless otherwise noted.
The reporting period is defined as the week ending on the penultimate Friday prior to the CFTC Swaps Reportâ€™s Wednesday publication date.
In other words, each CFTC Swaps Report presents data that is current as of the week ending two Fridays (12 days) before the publication of the Report.
For example, if the Report is published on Wednesday, February 19, the reporting period is the week ending Friday, February 7.
Federal holidays may delay some releases by one day.
